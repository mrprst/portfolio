        Hello, my name is Mathias. I used to lead e-commerce projects but I'm now web developer.
        In my past life, I had the chance of creating an online record shop and vinyl cuting service, work for a french audio/tech leader, a huge e-commerce website and one of the biggest music labels. All things considered, I have been specialized in e-commerce during all those years.
        I am currently working in France as freelancer but open to any opportunities allowing me to work remotly in EU.
