# Portfolio ! 

## How it has been built ? 
This portfolio is a first attempt for me to work with Typescript on a real project. I'm still learning to use it so don't blame me for the little 'any' you might see here. I've used React and Next.js to build it, and added a few Gsap animations. 

## Next.js for a static portfolio, really ? 
Yes, this might sound a bit overkill (and it does), but my first idea was to make this portfolio as a blog, ans Next.js SSR functionalities are still something I want to master so this is why. Plus I like dynamic routes. But in the end, I won't use it much so this portfolio might turn from SPA to MPA in a near future. I'm curious about the Island Pattern and a good old portfolio is a good place to start. 

## Me, myself and I 
Apart from training me with frameworks, this website is a small overview of my other projects, the ones I'm the most proud of, the ones that would help me get a job hopefully ! If you have anything that could fit, hit me up on Linkedin (link in bio).
